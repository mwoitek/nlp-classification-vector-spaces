nlp-classification-vector-spaces
================================

This repo contains some code I wrote as I was learning the fundamentals of
Natural Language Processing (NLP). To finish an on-line course on this subject,
I had to complete 4 programming assignments. My solution to the corresponding
problems is in the Jupyter notebooks listed below:

* [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/mwoitek/nlp-classification-vector-spaces/blob/master/Week1/C1_W1_Assignment.ipynb)
* [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/mwoitek/nlp-classification-vector-spaces/blob/master/Week2/C1_W2_Assignment.ipynb)
* [Word Embeddings](https://github.com/mwoitek/nlp-classification-vector-spaces/blob/master/Week3/C1_W3_Assignment.ipynb)
* [Word Translation](https://github.com/mwoitek/nlp-classification-vector-spaces/blob/master/Week4/C1_W4_Assignment.ipynb)
