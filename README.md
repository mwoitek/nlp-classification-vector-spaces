nlp-classification-vector-spaces
================================

This repo contains some code I wrote as I was learning the fundamentals of
Natural Language Processing (NLP). To finish an on-line course on this subject,
I had to complete 4 programming assignments. My solution to the corresponding
problems is in the Jupyter notebooks listed below:

* [Logistic Regression](x)
* [Naive Bayes](x)
* [Word Embeddings](x)
* [Word Translation](x)
