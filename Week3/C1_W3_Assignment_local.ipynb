    "natural language processing, we represent each word as a vector consisting of\n",

    "for each word are learned using various machine learning models, which we will\n",
    "explore in more detail later in this specialization. Rather than make you code\n",
    "the machine learning models from scratch, we will show you how to use them. In\n",
    "the real world, you can always load the trained word vectors, and you will\n",

    "# 3.0 Plotting the vectors using PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you will explore the distance between word vectors after reducing their\n",
    "dimension.\n",
    "The technique we will employ is known as\n",
    "[*principal component analysis*\n",
    "(PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis).\n",
    "As we saw, we are working in a 300-dimensional space in this case.\n",
    "Although from a computational perspective we were able to perform a good job,\n",
    "it is impossible to visualize results in such high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of PCA as a method that projects our vectors in a space of reduced\n",
    "dimension, while keeping the maximum information about the original vectors in\n",
    "their reduced counterparts. In this case, by *maximum infomation* we mean that\n",
    "the\n",
    "Euclidean distance between the original vectors and their projected siblings is\n",
    "minimal. Hence vectors that were originally close in the embeddings dictionary,\n",
    "will produce lower dimensional vectors that are still close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that when you map out the words, similar words will be clustered\n",
    "next to each other. For example, the words 'sad', 'happy', 'joyful' all describe\n",
    "emotion and are supposed to be near each other when plotted.\n",
    "The words: 'oil', 'gas', and 'petroleum' all describe natural resources.\n",
    "Words like 'city', 'village', 'town' could be seen as synonyms and describe a\n",
    "similar thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before plotting the words, you need to first be able to reduce each word vector\n",
    "with PCA into 2 dimensions and then plot it. The steps to compute PCA are as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean normalize the data\n",
    "2. Compute the covariance matrix of your data ($\\Sigma$).\n",
    "3. Compute the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of your covariance matrix\n",
    "4. Multiply the first K eigenvectors by your normalized data. The transformation\n",
    "should look something as follows:\n",

    "<img src = 'word_embf.jpg' width=\"width\" height=\"height\"\n",
    "style=\"width:800px;height:200px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "You will write a program that takes in a data set where each row corresponds to\n",
    "a word vector.\n",
    "* The word vectors are of dimension 300.\n",
    "* Use PCA to change the 300 dimensions to `n_components` dimensions.\n",
    "* The new matrix should be of dimension `m, n_componentns`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First de-mean the data\n",
    "* Get the eigenvalues using `linalg.eigh`.  Use `eigh` rather than `eig` since R\n",
    "is symmetric.  The performance gain when using `eigh` instead of `eig` is\n",
    "substantial.\n",
    "* Sort the eigenvectors and eigenvalues by decreasing order of the eigenvalues.\n",
    "* Get a subset of the eigenvectors (choose how many principle components you\n",
    "want to use using `n_components`).\n",
    "* Return the new transformation of the data by multiplying the eigenvectors with\n",
